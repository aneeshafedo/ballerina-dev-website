## Overview of Ballerina Swan Lake 2201.5.0

<em>2201.5.0 (Swan Lake Update 5) is the fourth update release of Ballerina Swan Lake, and it includes a new set of features and significant improvements to the compiler, runtime, standard library, and developer tooling. It is based on the 2022R4 version of the Language Specification.</em> 

## Update Ballerina

**If you are already using Ballerina 2201.0.0 (Swan Lake)**, run either of the commands below to directly update to 2201.5.0 using the [Ballerina Update Tool](/learn/cli-documentation/update-tool/).

`bal dist update` (or `bal dist pull 2201.5.0`)

**If you are using a version below 2201.0.0 (Swan Lake)**, run the commands below to update to 2201.5.0.

1. Run `bal update` to get the latest version of the Update Tool.

2. Run `bal dist update` ( or `bal dist pull 2201.5.0`) to update your Ballerina version to 2201.5.0.

However, if you are using a version below 2201.0.0 (Swan Lake) and if you already ran `bal dist update` (or `bal dist pull 2201.5.0`) before `bal update`, see [Troubleshooting](/downloads/swan-lake-release-notes/swan-lake-2201.0.0#troubleshooting) to recover your installation.

## Install Ballerina

If you have not installed Ballerina, download the [installers](/downloads/#swanlake) to install.

## Backward-incompatible changes

- Fixed a bug that resulted in invalid usage of additive expressions with operands of different incompatible basic types not resulting in a compilation error.

    ```ballerina
    public function main() {
        "abc"|string:Char a = "a";
        var b = a + 1; // compilation error now
        var c = ["a","b","c"].map(s => s + 1); // compilation error now
    } 
    ```

- Fixed a bug that previously resulted in incorrect type checking for an intersection with `readonly` against an incompatible union type as the expected type.

    ```ballerina
    type Employee record {|
        string[] name;
        int id;
    |};

    public function main() {
        json & readonly v = {};
        
        string|error r = v; // compilation error now
        Employee|string s = v.cloneReadOnly(); // compilation error now
    }
    ```

- Fixed a bug in dependently-typed function analysis which previously resulted in compilation errors not being logged when the `typedesc` argument is defined using a type definition (`T`) and the return type is a union (`T|t`) where the basic types for `T` and `t` are not disjoint.

    ```ballerina
    public type TargetType typedesc<anydata>;

    // already a compilation error
    function f1(typedesc<anydata> targetType = <>) returns targetType|json = external;

    // also a compilation error now
    function f2(TargetType targetType = <>) returns targetType|json = external;
    ```

- Fixed a bug that allowed using an included record parameter of the same name as that of a field of the parameter record type.
    
    ```ballerina
    type ErrorDetail record {|
        string 'error;
        int code;
        int[] locations?;
    |};
    
    function getError(*ErrorDetail 'error) { // compilation error now
    }
    ```

- Due to an internal API change, the GraphQL `1.7.0` package is not compatible with older Ballerina versions and older GraphQL versions are not compatible with Ballerina `2201.5.0`. When migrating to Ballerina `2201.5.0` from previous Ballerina distributions, the GraphQL version should be updated to `1.7.0` with this release.
